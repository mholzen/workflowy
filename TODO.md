- BUG: list --format=json should merge nodes

- default depth for list should probably be 1
- document bookmarklet
- document rate limiting on updating reports

- consider using markdown to nodes for uploading reports.

- add support for multiple reports, including "all"

- improve status and error reporting
  - error reporting looks like a log mesage (time not necessary)
  - status report for update is JSON, probably unnecessary

- ranking reports should support topN _and_ thresholds
