# Motivation
Value of a comprehensive taxonomy. We believe such a framework could provide confidence that all areas of human activity are accounted for thus enabling spending time and energy in parts. Furthermore, if we consider groups of humans to also exhibit properties of living organisms, we believe this framework can provide value to families, teams and organizations, large and small. By extension, this could also apply to artificial systems (ai, agents). We believe no such framework exists that explicitly aims at comprehensive coverage, to the exception of religious frameworks, which are outdated.

# 1 - present the descriptive framework of life
Life is difficult to define but can be described rather than defined. Describe in biology, at three scales. 7 characteristics. Add create. Organize by 3 dimensions. Describe the differences and relationships between aspects.

# 2 - demonstrate how all human experience is ... described? by this framework
All language is based on sensory physiological experience. Some organism’s experience exists without language. A framework cannot exist without language. A communicable framework cannot be referenced without comms. All human experience is tied to language. History of language evolution ? Language in a social setting gives us abstraction, "concepts about concepts". Some concepts that are difficult to justify. Some meta concepts that are difficult to justify. About this particular framework.

# 3 - map existing complete frameworks to it
Proof completeness is difficult, without mapping it to a system that is known to be complete. Maslow. Big 5. Project management techniques or organizational management techniques. Survey of goals of philosophy.

# Argue that each phenomenon describes a set of related concepts

## Introduce the 7 concepts
Organize: whole, part. Maintain: equality, balance, interface, physical identity. Respond. Metabolize: work, rest, energy, resource, having, power. Reproduce. Grow: aging, replenishing,direction, up, value, explore, need. Adapt: change, identity.

## These are not black or white concepts

Tensions exists between concepts.

For example, relationships between two concepts gives us a foundation for many complex concepts.

### Examples
Maintain and respond gives us a foundation for conscious, subconscious. Organize and maintain gives us a foundation for identity, property.

## Discuss ways to describe these concepts using language
Verbs and states. Nouns, specific identities. Opposites, antonyms. From concrete to abstract. Non-existence, absence of. In, out. But where do these dimensions come from? from the model itself.

# Make some assumptions, state self-evident truths, axioms (if you disagree with this, we won't get very far)

## We can recognize life in ourselves and around us in things other than ourselves
Life/death are as universal as can be. We might not agree on this description of life, but we can see life in other things. We have a lot of material available, of experiences to drawn upon. Yes, this is a self referential definition, which is why it's an axiom, an assumption.

## We are alive

You, I, others.

I am using the term "life" to describe something that we both are.

### Life and death are some of the most recognizable and powerful human experiences
Birth, death, joyful, painful, irreversible.

## We are using language to communicate and exchange ideas in the form of information
We are using language. Why is this important? Notice how difficult it is to think without speaking to yourself, using your inner voice. That happens of course, they are called feelings and emotions. Nonetheless, ... something. Sources.

# Argue that these concepts shape our experiences beyond the biological

## We need to relate abstract concepts back to something

### We use the biological realm to communicate because they are what we have in common with other humans
Balance: breathing. Money: getting food. Victory: destroy your competitor for resource or mate. Boredom: apathy from low energy.

## Argue that many (later all) experiences are rooted in the biology of your body

### Use 4 examples to demonstrate (exhaustive list comes later)
Behavior change (eg. eating better, start working out, etc...). Relational challenges (eg. work, family, friends, etc...). Art, creativity, passion. Emotions, mental health, suicide.

## Domains they might apply

### Social animals
Is the tribe, the clan alive.

### Basic social humans
Is the group, tribe, city, country, ethnicity alive?

### Mind
Are ideas alive.

### Modern social human constructs
Companies, social groups.

### Conceptual
Physics, science. Philosophy, ethics, morality.

## For each domain, explain how these concepts can be used to describe experiences that domain
They provide a useful framework. They also also provides a complete framework.

# Argue that they are valuable

## Find direction, calm by ways to start looking at a situation
Dominance, intensity vs secondary. Low to high awareness, understanding, including of self. Short va long term. Meditate mantra.

## Find understanding, introspection, learning, progress by breaking something into parts
Examples.

## Find new solutions, create, be creative, by combining principles
Integrate.

## How novel is this?
How does it relate to Maslow's pyramid of needs. Shakras? Or mbti or big5 or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality">Enneagram</a>.

# Argue that they are necessary
Find realism, pragmatism, health, science, honesty, confidence by anchor experience in the body. Unavoidability of life. Suicide.

# Argue that they are sufficient
Find calm, comfort, peace from the safety having "done perimeter". Can we use life and its description as guiding helpful principles?  first principles of existence? How to argue that something is sufficient? Evaluate large questions, topics, domains using the framework.

# Argue that they can adapt
Can I express other things as a combination of these?

# Log
Primitives of experience?

# Published goal
Explain why a finite list of concepts describing life biologically is sufficient and valuable to understand and guide the experience of human existence.

# Personal goal
Search for a personal philosophy made of helpful guiding principles. Primitives of experience. I share in the hopes it helps other identify and point out my personal biases. Search for a mental frameworkto help bring calm to a busy mindand emotional.

# Questions
Unknowability of the future. How do I integrate opposites for each concept. How do I speak of combination of each concept.
